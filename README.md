# Personal Page

I created a web application to gain hands-on experience with Express and React. For the backend, I used TypeScript with Express and utilized MongoDB as the database. On the frontend, I developed the user interface using React. The resulting website can be accessed using the following link: https://melihaydogdu.bio.

Overall, this project allowed me to gain practical knowledge and experience working with these popular web development technologies.

GitHub Actions is used to deploy the frontend and backend.
